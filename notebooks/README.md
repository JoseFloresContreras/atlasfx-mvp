# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.

## Naming Convention

Notebooks should be numbered sequentially to indicate their order:

- `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Initial data exploration and visualization
- `02_feature_analysis.ipynb` - Feature engineering and analysis
- `03_model_debugging.ipynb` - Model debugging and interpretation

## Best Practices

1. **Clear documentation**: Each notebook should have a markdown cell at the top explaining its purpose
2. **Clean outputs**: Clear outputs before committing to keep repository clean
3. **Reusable code**: Extract reusable code into `src/atlasfx/` modules
4. **Data references**: Use relative paths to reference data in `data/` directory
